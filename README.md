Foodsearch
==========

Foodsearch gives you an easy way to find food with special characteristics (e.g. glutenfree, dessert, ribs, healthy, vegan, etc.) and shows you pictures of dishes that match you search criteria.

It uses the database of "Eatme" (find more informations about eatme: [http://github.com/adrienbourgeois/eatme/](http://github.com/adrienbourgeois/eatme/).

This application is a great opportunity to put into practice my new angular skills. Indeed I used angular for the front-end and I'm amazed by the power of this framework. By amongst other I find it incredibly easy to implement the "filter" feature of the app and am very happy about the great responsivity that it gives.
